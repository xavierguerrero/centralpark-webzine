<h1>Central Park</h1>
<h3> Comprising 843 square acres, Manhattan's biggest park is known and loved around the world.</h3>
<p class="uno">Manhattan might be best known for its towering skyscrapers and bustling pavement, but there are few New York City locales more loved than the 843 acres of green that is Central Park.
Stretching from Midtown to Harlem, the park is a year-round natural oasis for locals and visitors alike.
With the city’s population ballooning in the mid-19th century, the New York State Legislature set aside a large swath of land to create a much-needed public park. After winning a design contest in 1858, landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were tasked with bringing to life what Olmsted called “the lungs of the city.”
The park has changed and evolved over the century and a half since then to become what it is today: a diverse public space encompassing forest paths, ponds and fountains, performance spaces and long, dreamy stretches of green. And the latest change came in June 2018 when the park became automobile-free.</p>

<p class="text1"> <strong>The Central Park Lake,</strong> in conjunction with the Ramble, creates an essential part of the “Greensward” design plan created by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux when designing the initial features of what would become Central Park.

What is now a stunning and picturesque 18-acre lake was once nothing more than a large, untamed swamp. After its excavation in 1857, the Lake was opened for its first winter of ice-skating in 1858. Until 1950, the Lake was used for ice-skating during the winter months and boating in the summer. After 1950, however, the skating rink was officially closed, allowing the Lake’s former wildlife inhabitants to take up residence there once more. As such, the Lake is now an excellent location for bird watching, where one can spot swans, ducks, and even the occasional egret or heron.
The second largest man-made body of water in the Park, the Lake provides wonderful opportunities for viewing its abundant flora and fauna from rowboats, which are available for rent during the spring and summer months at the Loeb Boathouse. Aside from taking a boat, other options for nature sightseeing include taking a Venetian-style gondola ride around the Lake, or simply walking along the shore.
